I am an undergraduate student at UC Santa Barbara majoring in computer science, looking towards artficial intelligence and machine learning. I am a highly motivated student, seeking to utilize excellent communication, interpersonal, and technical ability in an intern position in computer science or any related field.

Last summer, I worked as a software engineering intern at AMAX Engineering, working with senior software engineers to improve  the productive efficiency of servers by 15% and also forecast production time for each server  

When I'm not programming, you can find me climbing or lifting at the gym, spending time in nature, or playing a musical instrument(clarinet, piano, guitar).
